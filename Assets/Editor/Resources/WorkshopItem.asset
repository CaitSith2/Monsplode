  Title: Monsplode Modules
  Description: "[h1]Now you have a chance to get your Monsplode into the mod! Details
    below! [/h1]\r\n\r\n[h1] Monsplode Modules! [/h1]\r\n\r\nThis mod includes a regular
    module with a needy sister module.\r\nOn \"Monsplode, Fight!\" you have to deal
    the highest possible damage to your opponent.\r\nOn \"Who's that Monsplode?\"
    you have to find the name of a Monsplode by looking at it's shadow.\r\n\r\nManuals
    are included in the mod files but you can download from Timwi's site as well.
    Search for Monsplode. http://ktane.timwi.de/\r\nI owe a huge thanks to him for
    the manual by the way.\r\nI also want to thank KTANE Discord Community for finding
    bugs and helping me out with fixes.\r\n\r\nYou know a game with similar creatures
    and mechanics? You played it?\r\nThat's great! You will get a headstart!\r\n\r\nCopyright
    claims? I have no idea what you are talking about pal.\r\n\r\n( Jokes aside, I
    totally respect Nintendo, don't sue me or anything guys B) )\r\n\r\nModule types
    are \"[b]monsplodeFight[/b]\" and \"[b]monsplodeWho[/b]\", I am pretty ok if you
    want to use them on your mod/mission pack.\r\n\r\n[h1] Want your Monsplode in
    the game? Now live! [/h1]\r\n\r\n[strike]After we hit 200 subscribers mark, one
    or two of our great subscribers(at random) will have their creatures drawn and
    put in the mod on upcoming updates. [/strike]\r\n\r\n[b]You guys hit the goal.
    We are doing it now![/b]\r\n\r\n2 lucky winners will have one of their own Monsplode
    design (Pokemon-Like Creatures) drawn and added to our module set.\r\n\r\nThey
    will also be able to pick the special rules that Monsplode will have, if they
    want to. (As long as it doesn't break the gameplay balance.)\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT
    NOTES:\r\n\r\n- This is not a design competition, it's more like a raffle.\r\n-
    I don't expect you to submit a design when entering. \r\n- Winners will be picked
    at random, using \"gleam.io\" .\r\n- I am asking you to contact me in order to
    prevent spam.\r\n- I will contact winners when the time is out.\r\n\r\nHere is
    the announcement/entry link: https://twitter.com/Mantlair/status/815693446216290304\r\n\r\nWe
    have 22 Monsplodes now. I want to make it 24 at most to keep the complexity on
    a sane level. (And the manual length.)"
