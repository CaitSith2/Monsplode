  Title: Monsplode Modules
  Description: "[h1] Monsplode Modules! (Now much easier, with just one stage!) [/h1]\r\n\r\nThis
    mod includes a regular module with a needy sister module.\r\nOn \"Monsplode, Fight!\"
    you have to deal the highest possible damage to your opponent.\r\nOn \"Who's that
    Monsplode?\" you have to find the name of a Monsplode by looking at it's shadow.\r\n\r\nManuals
    are included in the mod files but you can download from Timwi's site as well.
    Search for Monsplode. http://ktane.timwi.de/\r\nI owe a huge thanks to him for
    the manual by the way.\r\n\r\nYou know a game with similar creatures and mechanics?
    You played it?\r\nThat's great! You will get a headstart!\r\n\r\nCopyright claims?
    I have no idea what you are talking about pal.\r\n\r\n( Jokes aside, I totally
    respect Nintendo, don't sue me or anything guys B) )\r\n\r\n-- [b]Latest Changes[/b]
    --\r\n\r\n- 8 New Monsplodes.\r\n- Fight module is now 1 stage, instead of 3.\r\n\r\n[h1]
    Vote on the stage count of \"Monsplode, Fight!\" [/h1]\r\n\r\nModule types are
    \"[b]monsplodeFight[/b]\" and \"[b]monsplodeWho[/b]\", I am pretty ok if you want
    to use them on your mod/mission pack.\r\n\r\n[h1] Want your Monsplode in the game?
    [/h1]\r\n\r\nAfter we hit 200 subscribers mark, one or two of our great subscribers(at
    random) will have their creatures drawn and put in the mod on upcoming updates.
    We have 22 Monsplodes now. I want to make it 24 at most to keep the complexity
    on a sane level. (And the manual length.)"
