  Title: Monsplode Modules
  Description: "[h1]Now you have a chance to get your Monsplode into the mod! Details
    below! [/h1]\r\n\r\n[h1] Monsplode Modules! [/h1]\r\n\r\nThis mod includes a regular
    module with a needy sister module.\r\nOn \"Monsplode, Fight!\" you have to deal
    the highest possible damage to your opponent.\r\nOn \"Who's that Monsplode?\"
    you have to find the name of a Monsplode by looking at it's shadow.\r\n\r\nManuals
    are included in the mod files but you can download from Timwi's site as well.
    Search for Monsplode. http://ktane.timwi.de/\r\nI owe a huge thanks to him for
    the manual by the way.\r\nI also want to thank KTANE Discord Community for finding
    bugs and helping me out with fixes.\r\n\r\nYou know a game with similar creatures
    and mechanics? You played it?\r\nThat's great! You will get a headstart!\r\n\r\nCopyright
    claims? I have no idea what you are talking about pal.\r\n\r\n( Jokes aside, I
    totally respect Nintendo, don't sue me or anything guys B) )\r\n\r\nModule types
    are \"[b]monsplodeFight[/b]\" and \"[b]monsplodeWho[/b]\", I am pretty ok if you
    want to use them on your mod/mission pack.\r\n\r\nWe have 22 Monsplodes now. I
    want to make it 24 at most to keep the complexity on a sane level. (And the manual
    length.)\nWe have contacted with the contest/raffle winners. New Monsplodes will
    be here as soon as the designs are ready."
