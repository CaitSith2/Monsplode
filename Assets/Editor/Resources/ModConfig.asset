  title: Monsplode Modules
  description: "[h1] Monsplode Modules! [/h1]\r\n\r\nThis mod includes 2 regular modules
    with a needy sister module.\r\nOn \"Monsplode, Fight!\" you have to deal the highest
    possible damage to your opponent.\r\nOn \"Monsplode Trading Cards\" you have to
    accept or decline trading offers according to the card values.\r\nOn \"Who's that
    Monsplode?\" you have to find the name of a Monsplode by looking at it's shadow.\r\n\r\nManuals
    are included in the mod files but you can download from Timwi's site as well.
    Search for Monsplode. http://ktane.timwi.de/ I owe a huge thanks to him for the
    manual by the way.\r\n\r\nWelcome to v3.50. We have a new module with some extra
    artwork!\r\nMain idea for the Trading Card module came from Grybo.\r\nAlso most
    cards are missing it's flavour text for now. [url=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfzbMKMnmmRFrrl8RiVTHnZpjixUDsOOQVXadD4gnIQzY3WwQ/viewform]Please
    help me come up with ideas.[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had a raffe/contest where 2 people
    got chosen randomly to design a new monsplode for the modules.\r\nThey are in
    the modules now. Say hi to [url=https://github.com/mantlair/Monsplode/blob/master/Assets/CreaturesModule/Sprites/Percy.png]

    Cutie Pie [/url] (Submitted by Timwi)!\r\n\r\n\r\nI also want to thank KTANE Discord
    Community for finding bugs and helping me out with fixes.\r\n\r\nYou know a game
    with similar creatures and mechanics? You played it?\r\nThat's great! You will
    get a headstart!\r\n\r\nCopyright claims? I have no idea what you are talking
    about pal.\r\n\r\n( Jokes aside, I totally respect Nintendo, don't sue me or anything
    guys B) )\r\n\r\nModule types are \"[b]monsplodeFight[/b]\", \"[b]monsplodeWho[/b]\"
    and \"[b]monsplodeCards[/b]\" I am pretty ok if you want to use them on your mod/mission
    pack.\r\n\r\n"
